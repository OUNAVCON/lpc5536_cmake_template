Overview
========

The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal VREF ladder is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal VREF's value. The change of
comparator's output would generate the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any CMP 
interrupt happens, the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's rising edge, or turn off it when
detecting the output's falling edge.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
(pmux)VREF connect to 1.6V (3.3V * 15 /31).
(nmux)J44-21(PIO1_14).

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

CMP interrupt driver example.
RED LED turn on.(pmux > nmux).
RED LED turn off.(pmux < nmux).
