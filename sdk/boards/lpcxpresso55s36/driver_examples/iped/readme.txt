Overview
========
The IPED Example project is a demonstration program that uses the MCUX SDK software to set up Inline Prince Encryption Decryption.
Then tests the expected behaviour.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
 Connect pin 1-2 of JP41,JP42,JP43 ,JP44,JP45,JP64 and JP65.Close JP66,JP67,JP68 and JP69.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the terminal displays similar information like the following:
