Overview
========

The HSCMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use HSCMP driver and help user with a quick start.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
HSCMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() function
would detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would be turned on when the compare
output is logic one, or turned off when zero.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.1
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.8.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- Personal Computer
- LPCXpresso55S36 board

Board settings
==============
This example project uses HSCMP to compare the voltage signal input from channel 3(P1_5)
with the voltage signal(half of VREF_OUT) output by HSCMP's internal DAC and output different result.
LED_RED will turn ON/OFF corresponding to different result. So the voltage signal input from P1_28
should be changed to observe the dynamical LED state.
- Input signal to J9-9

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect the micro and mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB ports(J1) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for the serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.
